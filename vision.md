# Project Vision: Galleria Expressive

*"The main focus of this project was to learn, as I am a student."*

## The Genesis
This project didn't start as an attempt to build the next tech giant's flagship product. It started as a playground. A place to make mistakes, to learn how different pieces of technology talk to each other, and to understand the "why" behind modern software architecture.

Along the way, it evolved into an exploration of **Material Design 3 (M3) Expressive UI** — pushing the boundaries of what a local desktop app can feel like when you bring web-based design systems into a native context.

## Core Philosophy

1. **Learning Above All:** Every architectural choice — from Rust backends to Svelte stores — was made to learn how these ecosystems function and interlock.
2. **Aesthetic Exploration:** Moving away from standard desktop UI constraints, the app embraces M3 Expressive design: floating elements, cinematic layouts, bold typography, and dynamic palettes.
3. **Respecting the User's Hardware:** "Offline-first" isn't just a buzzword here; it's a commitment to building software that works fast and respects data privacy by keeping everything local.

## The Design Language: M3 Expressive
We abandoned the old "Liquid Glass" ideas in favor of Google's Material 3 Expressive guidelines. This means:
- **Tonal Palettes:** Colors aren't just accents; they subtly tint the entire application surface to create cohesive moods (Lavender, Mauve, Sage, Ocean, Coral).
- **Immersive Layouts:** The "Expressive" photo grid mode acts like a digital mosaic, allowing photos to tessellate dynamically like puzzle pieces instead of living in rigid boxes.
- **Micro-Interactions:** From hover states to staggered animations, the UI should feel alive and responsive to touch or click.

## What's Next?
As a student project, the roadmap is fluid. What matters isn't necessarily reaching a "1.0" feature-complete state, but rather what is learned along the way:
- Deepening my understanding of Rust's ownership model by expanding the Tauri backend.
- Learning advanced image processing techniques (WASM or Rust-native).
- Mastering cross-platform deployment.

## The Role of AI in this Journey
Some might look at this project and say, *"AI just wrote all the code."* But that misses the point. 

Yes, AI is the engine that generates the syntax, but **I am the architect and the driver.** The true learning happens in the "why" and the "how." By directing an AI to build this, I am learning:
- How to structure a modern full-stack application.
- How reactivity models (like Svelte's stores versus React's hooks) fundamentally change how a UI behaves.
- How to debug complex state gaps between a Rust backend and a JavaScript frontend.
- How to translate abstract design concepts (like Material 3 tonal palettes) into concrete CSS architectures.

AI is my pair-programmer, but the vision, the troubleshooting, and the ultimate technical education belong to me.

*This is a journey documented in code.*
